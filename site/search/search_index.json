You are our eyes and ears of the guild. If there are members worth highlighting for positive or negative reasons, please share those through the the-round-table. Keepers may be asked to perform other duties from time to time to test ability or fill holes. Noble \u2013 These are our lead recruitment officers/officer rank 2. These members have proved dedication to their craft and will make sure the recruitments get done, no matter what. Nobles should be able to analyze the guild membership and make the call for when Keepers & Nobles should be making their rounds. Be vocal about when the membership dips for whatever reason and encourage the Keepers to get the numbers up. Our Nobles are very familiar with recruitment tactics and I encourage the Keepers to reach out if you need help. Scribe \u2013 The Scribe role focuses on functionality and data; they serve as an officer rank 3. They are in charge of making sure our notes in guild and in discord are up to date. Scribes assist with trial role verifications, monitoring discord for issues and facilitate roster burn downs. If a guild member\u2019s note needs adjustment or a you see a tag missing from someone\u2019s discord profile, then please reach out to the Scribe for adjustments. Council \u2013 Council members are decision making body and serve as officer rank 4. These are hand selected individuals that focus on specific divisions of guild management. At times they wear many different hats and will need to fill gaps in our officer memberships. They contribute to the guild in many ways. These members are expected to be online more frequently than others and be ready to make swift enforcement decisions. Council votes on guild direction topics and other decisions made in the background. Hands \u2013 Hands are our Co-GM\u2019s of the guild and officer rank 5. Their focus is on all aspects of guild management. They may specialize, similarly to Council, but also required to be well rounded. Directional discussions can be made at this level then presented to Council and/or all officers for feedback. Hands must be willing to place guild management above personal gain and do what it takes to keep the guild functioning at all times. This rank serves as the acting GM, if the GM is unavailable. King \u2013 The King is our GM and owner of the guild, serving as an officer rank 6. The King is expected to uphold all etiquettes in the guild, as well as the officer rules. This rank relies on trust in all of the lower officer levels for input and guidance to make sound decisions. The King must be able to fill the need of the guild for any deficiencies and perform all duties of each officer role as needed. Each week they are to secure a trader and keep up on guild trends. The King facilitates senior officer discussions and proposes core ideas to the Council before moving forward in direction. End note: All officers have different levels of benefits and permission sets in the guild. I encourage everyone to read which officers have specific permissions in the rank system in game. I cannot thank all of you enough on what you do for the guild and I have much gratitude on your willingness to keep the guild functioning at every level!","title":"About Our Ranks"},{"location":"rank/#our-guild-ranks","text":"Rank Description Leadership Level King Guild Master 5 Hands CO-GM 4 Council Senior Officer 3 Noble Lead Recruiter 2 Keeper Recruiter 1 Master at Arms PvP & PvE Master Non-Leader Warrior PvP Master Non-Leader Knight Active Member Veteran Non-Leader Squire Active Member Normal Non-Leader Common New/General Member Non-Leader","title":"Our Guild Ranks"},{"location":"rank/#officer-level-rank-specifics","text":"Keeper \u2013 These are our entry level officers/officer rank 1 and serve as our primary recruiters after guild roster burn downs.

I expect all officers to be online at least once every 10 days. Or communicate with me if you will be absent for an extended period of time. There are exceptions to this on a case-by-case basis. And of course be active in your specific officer ranks duties! Enforcement \u2013 If you see someone that is being dysfunctional in guild chat. Inform them that this type of communication is prohibited. Then immediately inform the rest of the officer team via Discord. If the negative communication continues after your initial warning, then either remove the member from guild or notify a senior officer who can remove them for you. If the comments violate the \u201cNo Prejudice\u201d rule in guild-etiquette, please inform senior officers that are able to kick the member immediately. Officers should be versed in the guild etiquette and should try to be versed trial etiquette as well, if you are a trialer. Participate \u2013 I encourage all officers to participate with our guildies. Whether it is in the form of guild chat, Discord chat, participating in trial runs, housing contests, etc. We are the lifeblood of the guild and many of the members look to us for consistency and guidance. That doesn\u2019t mean you have to run with everyone all the time, I do understand needing to have self-focused activities. All I\u2019m asking is to jump in there once and a while. Input \u2013 At times there may be questions posted in the-round-table . I expect and encourage all officers to weigh in on these questions. They help the Council decide on topics as we discuss options. We are a community lead guild and there are times we would like to know more about your opinions, before moving forward in a specific direction. Content Rules Grouping \u2013 Grouping for content typically happens 15 minutes before event start time. Please let your host know if you\u2019re going to be cutting it close, so your position isn\u2019t filled by another. Make sure you have read the description of the event you are signed up for so that you meet any stated requirements. If you cannot make the event, please do your best to notify the host or remove yourself from the sign-up as soon as possible. Consistent no shows may cause you to be unable to sign up for future events. Performance \u2013 Be trial ready by the time the event start time. Meaning food is active, proper gear equipped/repaired, potions slotted, weapons charged, and inventory cleared. Follow hosts instructions and clear comms when asked. Know your role to the best of your ability, if you have questions about gear and skill loadouts, ask. Trial Specifics \u2013 Trial hosts operate differently, so do your best to listen to their instructions, requests for gear/skill loadouts, and read the sign-up description for requirements. Wait for crown to inform the group before starting. Stay in your stacks when required for mechanics and better healing. The person running the trial will provide mechanic callouts. Be respectful of their direction, if you feel like something is missed or want to add to the callout, wait until they are finished giving direction. As mentioned earlier, clear comms when asked so the callouts can be given without chatter. Wait for the trial to complete before exchanging gear and it is normal practice NOT to charge fellow trialers for gear swaps. Event Signups \u2013 If you are signing up for content that has specific requirements, such as dps damage ratings or trial clears please make sure you have provided your submissions to the verification channels. For dps this means submitting a parse video with trial clears. For support roles please submit your gear load and clears. If you do not have a submission with the guild, there is not a guarantee that you will be allowed to participate, that decision will be left to the host. The guild is a family, and we want to help facilitate your experience in trials. We cannot guarantee the experience you will have in every trial ran through our trial-finder will be the best. But there will be teaching runs offered regularly, this is a great environment to learn without feeling stressed about performance. If you post a trial run through the guild you are expected to remain courteous and friendly, even if the trial doesn\u2019t seem to be going as well as hoped for. If there are issues with guild members during your runs, please inform an officer so we can handle it in a professional manner.
