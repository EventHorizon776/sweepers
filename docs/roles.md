# About your role

General rules for all officers:

1.    Active – Our general membership has a requirement to be online or show online at least once per 20 days. I expect all officers to be online at least once every 10 days. Or communicate with me if you will be absent for an extended period of time. There are exceptions to this on a case-by-case basis. And of course be active in your specific officer ranks duties!

2.    Enforcement – If you see someone that is being dysfunctional in guild chat. Inform them that this type of communication is prohibited. Then immediately inform the rest of the officer team via Discord. If the negative communication continues after your initial warning, then either remove the member from guild or notify a senior officer who can remove them for you. If the comments violate the “No Prejudice” rule in guild-etiquette, please inform senior officers that are able to kick the member immediately. Officers should be versed in the guild etiquette and should try to be versed trial etiquette as well, if you are a trialer.

3.    Participate – I encourage all officers to participate with our guildies. Whether it is in the form of guild chat, Discord chat, participating in trial runs, housing contests, etc. We are the lifeblood of the guild and many of the members look to us for consistency and guidance. That doesn’t mean you have to run with everyone all the time, I do understand needing to have self-focused activities. All I’m asking is to jump in there once and a while.

4.    Input – At times there may be questions posted in the-round-table . I expect and encourage all officers to weigh in on these questions. They help the Council decide on topics as we discuss options. We are a community lead guild and there are times we would like to know more about your opinions, before moving forward in a specific direction.
