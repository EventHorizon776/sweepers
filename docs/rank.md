### Officer Level Rank Specifics

Keeper – These are our entry level officers/officer rank 1 and serve as our primary recruiters after guild roster burn downs. You are our eyes and ears of the guild. If there are members worth highlighting for positive or negative reasons, please share those through the the-round-table. Keepers may be asked to perform other duties from time to time to test ability or fill holes.

Noble – These are our lead recruitment officers/officer rank 2. These members have proved dedication to their craft and will make sure the recruitments get done, no matter what. Nobles should be able to analyze the guild membership and make the call for when Keepers & Nobles should be making their rounds. Be vocal about when the membership dips for whatever reason and encourage the Keepers to get the numbers up. Our Nobles are very familiar with recruitment tactics and I encourage the Keepers to reach out if you need help.

Scribe – The Scribe role focuses on functionality and data; they serve as an officer rank 3. They are in charge of making sure our notes in guild and in discord are up to date. Scribes assist with trial role verifications, monitoring discord for issues and facilitate roster burn downs. If a guild member’s note needs adjustment or a you see a tag missing from someone’s discord profile, then please reach out to the Scribe for adjustments.

Council – Council members are decision making body and serve as officer rank 4. These are hand selected individuals that focus on specific divisions of guild management. At times they wear many different hats and will need to fill gaps in our officer memberships. They contribute to the guild in many ways. These members are expected to be online more frequently than others and be ready to make swift enforcement decisions. Council votes on guild direction topics and other decisions made in the background.

Hands – Hands are our Co-GM’s of the guild and officer rank 5. Their focus is on all aspects of guild management. They may specialize, similarly to Council, but also required to be well rounded. Directional discussions can be made at this level then presented to Council and/or all officers for feedback. Hands must be willing to place guild management above personal gain and do what it takes to keep the guild functioning at all times. This rank serves as the acting GM, if the GM is unavailable.

King – The King is our GM and owner of the guild, serving as an officer rank 6. The King is expected to uphold all etiquettes in the guild, as well as the officer rules. This rank relies on trust in all of the lower officer levels for input and guidance to make sound decisions. The King must be able to fill the need of the guild for any deficiencies and perform all duties of each officer role as needed. Each week they are to secure a trader and keep up on guild trends. The King facilitates senior officer discussions and proposes core ideas to the Council before moving forward in direction.

End note: All officers have different levels of benefits and permission sets in the guild. I encourage everyone to read which officers have specific permissions in the rank system in game. I cannot thank all of you enough on what you do for the guild and I have much gratitude on your willingness to keep the guild functioning at every level!
